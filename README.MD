# GT Vein Locator
This minecraft forge mod is an addon for GregTech5/6.

It adds several tiers of items called "locators" which could help you locate GregTech's veins in-game.
* the basic vein locator could show you the central coordinates of 9 veins nearby
* the advanced vein locator could show you the 9 veins directly in JourneyMap/Xaero's Minimap in the form of waypoints
* the elite vein locator has the same function of the advanced locator, but it will automatically add the name of the veins in your minimap  

Tips:   
* shift right-click will change the scanning range of all tiers of locators
* there're lots of configurations you could set in GTVL's config, which means you could balance them by yourself in your modpack
